                    <h3> 1 .difference between var let and const</h3>
                    <p>Ans : var keyword in JavaScript: The var is the oldest keyword to declare a variable in JavaScript. 
                        Scope: Global scoped or function scoped. The scope of the var keyword is the global or function scope. It means variables defined outside the function can be accessed globally, and variables defined inside a particular function can be accessed within the function. but let keyword in JavaScript: The let keyword is an improved version of the var keyword. Scope: block scoped: The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It canâ€™t be accessible outside the particular block ({block}).And In const keyword in JavaScript: The const keyword has all the properties that are the same as the let keyword, except the user cannot update it.
                        Scope: block scoped: When users declare a const variable, they need to initialize it, otherwise, it returns an error. The user cannot update the const variable once it is declared. </p>

                    <h3> 2 .difference between arrow function vs normal function</h3>
                    <p>JavaScript's arrow functions might seem the same as regular functions on the surface, but they have some very important differences: Syntactical differences,this value (execution context),Usage as methods,Usage as constructors,arguments binding</p>

                    <h3> 3 .difference between map forEach fillter and Find</h3>
                    <p>.forEach(), is used to execute the same code on every element in an array but does not change the array and it returns undefined..map() executes the same code on every element in an array and returns a new array with the updated elements.filter() checks every element in an array to see if it meets a certain criteria and returns a new array with the elements that return truthy for the criteria. and find returns the first items in an array that satisfies a condition</p>
